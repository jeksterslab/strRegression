$Y$ is the regressand variable,
$X_1, \cdots, X_j, \cdots, X_p$ are the $p$ regressand variables,
and
$\varepsilon$ is the stochastic error term
with expected value of zero and finite variance $\sigma^2$,
$\alpha$ is the intercept,
and
$\beta_1, \cdots, \beta_j, \cdots, \beta_p$
are the partial regression slopes.
